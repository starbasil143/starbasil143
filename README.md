## HELLO!!!

My name is Luke! I'm passionate about math and programming, especially relating to theoretical math and game development. I love working on problems that challenge my problem-solving skills, both from a programming perspective and from a design perspective. I also very much enjoy creating visual and musical assets for my projects.
